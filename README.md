This application helps organizations efficiently manage complex projects, track deliverables, and coordinate among internal teams, clients, and external vendors — all within a unified, collaborative interface.

---

## Overview

The Project Management App is designed to streamline project execution through structured planning, real-time collaboration, automated notifications, and comprehensive reporting. It includes client and vendor portals, advanced Gantt chart visualization, task assignment workflows, role-based access controls, and integrations with **Raven** for bot-powered messaging and notifications.

The app is best suited for teams working on milestone-driven projects with deliverables and dependencies across multiple stakeholders.
